The assignments would be split in three-ish phases:

1. Manual audit a codebase and try your best to find vulnerabilities, that's ok if none are found.

2. Review the official audit report and see what you missed. For every finding you have missed write down what question you could have asked yourself that would have led to finding the vulnerability.

3. Write proof-of-concepts (POC) for every finding (selected by me).

Then I'll review your POCs and give you further feedback.

Bear in mind these assignments will be based on past public audits, that means you can easily find the answer to what has been found if you want to.

However, it is in your best interest to wait until step #2 until looking into them. Otherwise you are just handicapping your learning opportunity.
